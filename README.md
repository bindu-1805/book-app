# Book application 

This is a book app developed using EJS, CSS, Node, Express and PostgreSql. Used the Open Library Covers API to fetch book covers. <br />
1. You can add a new book, edit and delete an existing book.
2. You can sort the list of books by the date added or by ratings.

This application is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/book)  <br />

## Getting started 

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bindu-1805/book-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd book-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if needed)
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. In the db.js file replace your database name and password.
   
5. Run the app
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

## Note

While adding a new book, get the Open Library cover id from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/). This will correctly fetch the book covers.
